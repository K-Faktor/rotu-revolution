## Overview
Reign of the Undead - Revolution is the *inofficial* successor to the famous Reign of the Undead mod for Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare originally made by Bipo and Etheross.

Reign of the Undead - Revolution (or RotU-R) aims to provide a different approach with new features, new weapons, new zombies and new gameplay elements.

## Current Release
The current publicly available and the recommended version is **0.7-alpha** which can be downloaded at

https://rotu-revolution.com/download.php

This version of the mod is compatible with Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare 1.7, 1.7a and the latest iterations of CoD4x 1.8.

## Repository Reasons
We are actively developing a more refined and optimized version of RotU-R, which takes time. The changes include script and performance optimizations, gameplay changes, more replayability, bot behaviour changes, and more.

The reason behind making this project open-source was our hope that the mod itself can be adapted by clans and groups to be designed "their way". Luk himself adapted RotU 2.1 for LukServers which resulted in a first iteration of RotU-R lateron.

The current development team consisting of Luk and 3aGl3 is regularly busy with real life stuff, so development can be rather slow.

We could use some support in the menu-designing and overall scripting parts of the mod development. Feel free to contact either of us.
